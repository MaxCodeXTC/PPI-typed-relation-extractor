A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) MEK1, MEK2, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. Here we demonstrated that MKK7 recognizes its target JNK by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of MKK7. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind JNK1 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length MKK7 containing combined D1/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to JNK1 and exhibited reduced JNK1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type MKK7. Peptide versions of the D-sites from MKK4 or the JIP-1 scaffold protein inhibited MKK7-JNK binding, suggesting that all three JNK regulators bind to the same region of JNK. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of MKK7 inhibited the ability of JNK1 and JNK2 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates c-Jun and ATF2, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with MKK7 for docking to JNK. Finally, MKK7-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of JNK1 versus ERK2. We conclude that MKK7 contains three JNK-docking sites that interact to selectively bind JNK and contribute to JNK signal transmission and specificity.</td>\n",

Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind P45983 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length O14733 containing combined D1/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to P45983 and exhibited reduced P45983 kinase activity when compared with wild-type O14733. Peptide versions of the D-sites from P45985 or the Q9UQF2 scaffold protein inhibited O14733-P45983 binding, suggesting that all three P45983 regulators bind to the same region of P45983. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of O14733 inhibited the ability of P45983 and P45984 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates P05412 and P15336, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with O14733 for docking to P45983. Finally, O14733-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of P45983 versus P28482. We conclude that O14733 contains three P45983-docking sites that interact to selectively bind P45983 and contribute to P45983 signal transmission and specificity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) MEK1, MEK2, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. Here we demonstrated that MKK7 recognizes its target JNK by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of MKK7. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind JNK1 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length MKK7 containing combined D1/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to JNK1 and exhibited reduced JNK1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type MKK7. Peptide versions of the D-sites from MKK4 or the JIP-1 scaffold protein inhibited MKK7-JNK binding, suggesting that all three JNK regulators bind to the same region of JNK. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of MKK7 inhibited the ability of JNK1 and JNK2 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates c-Jun and ATF2, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with MKK7 for docking to JNK. Finally, MKK7-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of JNK1 versus ERK2. We conclude that MKK7 contains three JNK-docking sites that interact to selectively bind JNK and contribute to JNK signal transmission and specificity.</td>\n",

Here we demonstrated that MKK7 recognizes its target JNK by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of MKK7. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind JNK1 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length MKK7 containing combined D1/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to JNK1 and exhibited reduced JNK1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type MKK7.

Stress-induced kinases phosphorylate p53 thereby enhancing its stability, leading to an increase in transactivation of its target genes. Several different protein kinases phosphorylate p53 on multiple amino acid residues. Here, we report for the first time that Cyclin dependent kinase 9, whose well-known substrate is RNA polymerase II, can also phosphorylate p53. Specifically, Ser33 on the N-terminus and, Ser315 and Ser392 on the C-terminus of p53 were found to be phosphorylated. The precise biological role of this phosphorylation remains to be elucidated.   \n",

       "1445   D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) Q02750, P36507, P46734, P45985, and P52564. Here we demonstrated that O14733 recognizes its target P45983 by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of O14733. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind P45983 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length O14733 containing combined D1/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to P45983 and exhibited reduced P45983 kinase activity when compared with wild-type O14733. Peptide versions of the D-sites from P45985 or the Q9UQF2 scaffold protein inhibited O14733-P45983 binding, suggesting that all three P45983 regulators bind to the same region of P45983. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of O14733 inhibited the ability of P45983 and P45984 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates P05412 and P15336, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with O14733 for docking to P45983. Finally, O14733-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of P45983 versus P28482.

Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of O14733 inhibited the ability of P45983 and P45984 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates P05412 and P15336, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with O14733 for docking to P45983. Finally, O14733-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of P45983 versus P28482. We conclude that O14733 contains three P45983-docking sites that interact to selectively bind P45983 and contribute to P45983 signal transmission and specificity.   \n",
       "1420   D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) Q02750, P36507, P46734, P45985, and P52564. Here we demonstrated that O14733 recognizes its target P45983 by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of O14733. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7beta to bind P45983 by about 50-70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80-90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%.

Stress-induced kinases phosphorylate P04637 thereby enhancing its stability, leading to an increase in transactivation of its target genes. Several different protein kinases phosphorylate P04637 on multiple amino acid residues. Here, we report for the first time that P50750, whose well-known substrate is RNA polymerase II, can also phosphorylate P04637. Specifically, Ser33 on the N-terminus and, Ser315 and Ser392 on the C-terminus of P04637 were found to be phosphorylated. The precise biological role of this phosphorylation remains to be elucidated.   \n",
