Expression on T cells and association with IL-7 driven proliferation.\nAlthough both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7.\nThis responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation.\nWe have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein.\nIn this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated.\nTo determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation.\nThese analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R.\nIL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity.\nDeglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor.\nIn agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R.\nThese antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R.\nIn addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R.\nThese data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains.\nTaken together these data suggest that the 76-kDa receptor is a novel high affinity IL-7R that may be necessary for IL-7 driven proliferation in human T cells.",
    "2438": "A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist.\nInflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1).\nThree naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2).\nIL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known.\nHere we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA.\nThe receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains.\nDomains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker.\nResidues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis.\nA region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex.\nModelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.",

    "4422": "Role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells.\nCellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic.\nTo characterize these pathways, we focused on changes in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence.\nAs a model, we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell (HPEC) and human uroepithelial cell (HUC) cultures.\nAfter 30-40 population doublings cells became growth-arrested in G0\/1 with a threefold decrease in Cdk2-associated activity, a point defined as pre-senescence.\nTemporally following this growth arrest, the cells develop a senescence morphology and express senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal).\nLevels of p16(INK4a) and p57(KIP2) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures.\nThe induced expression of p57, similar to p16, produces a senescent-like phenotype.\npRB, cyclin D, p19(INK4d) and p27(KIP1) decrease in both cell types.\nWe find that p53, p21(CIP1) and p15(INK4b) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre-senescent growth arrest, then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence.\nAnalysis of p53, p21(CIP1), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), and p57(KIP2) reveals altered expression in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells.\nThese results indicate: (i) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence, (ii) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence, and (iii) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization.",
    "2166": "The three human syntrophin genes are expressed in diverse tissues, have distinct chromosomal locations, and each bind to dystrophin and its relatives.\nThe syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins.\nWe have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin.\nComparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity.\nThe deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance.\nIn contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues.\nSomatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2.\nFinally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin\/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein."
