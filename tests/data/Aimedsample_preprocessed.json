    "4560": "We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of PROTEIN1 and its association with the PROTEIN2 - PROTEIN complex may contribute to the activation of the PROTEIN pathway by PROTEIN .",
    "3470": "The results showed that PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene ( PROTEIN2 ) expression in TF-1 cells.",
    "2726": " PROTEIN1 is shown to interact with the largest subunit ( PROTEIN ) of human PROTEIN through its central region and with multiple activators--including PROTEIN , PROTEIN , PROTEIN2 , PROTEIN , adenoviral PROTEIN , and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 PROTEIN proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain.",
    "434": "Differential expression of PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired PROTEIN2 expression withprogression of cancer.",
    "3184": "In the case of PROTEIN1 , activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. PROTEIN does not bind to the PROTEIN receptor, but PROTEIN binds to both the PROTEIN and PROTEIN2 , and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on PROTEIN overlap.",
    "4002": " PROTEIN1 binds specifically to 3' splice sites, but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for PROTEIN2 .",
    "4323": "These data imply that PROTEIN -induced dimerization of PROTEIN is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric ( PROTEIN1 PROTEIN PROTEIN2 )2 complex.",
    "5339": "Thymocyte activation induces the association of PROTEIN and PROTEIN1 with PROTEIN2 .",
    "3541": "In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned PROTEIN were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the PROTEIN PROTEIN but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 .",
    "143": "Genetic profile of 22 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of PROTEIN , PROTEIN1 , PROTEIN and PROTEIN \/ PROTEIN2 .",
    "1355": "As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate-reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes, the reconstituted PROTEIN1 multiprotein complex contains PROTEIN2 , which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for PROTEIN association.",
    "3675": "We previously have shown that PROTEIN purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PROTEIN1 , -beta, -gamma, and -delta.",
    "5090": "Thus PROTEIN1 is a cellular oncogene that targets PROTEIN2 and PROTEIN , both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters.",
    "840": "Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PROTEIN suppresses transactivation by PROTEIN \/ PROTEIN but not by PROTEIN \/ PROTEIN1 heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of PROTEIN2 \/ PROTEIN .",
    "628": "We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of PROTEIN PROTEIN ( PROTEIN ) is crucial for binding PROTEIN .Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in PROTEIN1 binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the PROTEIN2 ( PROTEIN or PROTEIN ) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.",
    "1959": "We propose that (i) the PROTEIN and the PROTEIN share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, PROTEIN1 and PROTEIN , and (ii) PROTEIN2 interacts with the PROTEIN in a fashion that is different from that used by PROTEIN .",
    "3370": " PROTEIN1 interacts with PROTEIN in the presence of PROTEIN to generate a structure similar to 17S PROTEIN , which suggests a function for PROTEIN and PROTEIN in the incorporation of PROTEIN2 into the spliceosome.",
    "3845": "Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like PROTEIN1 , both beta 2- and PROTEIN interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of PROTEIN , PROTEIN2 \/ PROTEIN related protein, and the PROTEIN .",
    "1234": "We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of PROTEIN ( PROTEIN1 ) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands PROTEIN or PROTEIN and the epithelial splice form of PROTEIN ( PROTEIN ) to be activated by PROTEIN , PROTEIN2 , and PROTEIN .",
    "5068": "Intriguingly, PROTEIN1 - PROTEIN2 binding is directly antagonized by Ca2+\/ PROTEIN ."
